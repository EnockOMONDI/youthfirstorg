            At Youth First.Org, we believe that an empowered youth is an Enabled youth. We are committed to changing youth’s lives. We are doing this through a well researched program known as Youth Entrepreneurship,Leadership and Mentorship Program (YELM) which has been broken down into three main components namely; Leadership and Entrepreneurship Course Training, Mentorship and Financial empowerment. Our target is the youth between 15 years to 24 years who are passionate about leadership and entrepreneurship</p>

        </p>
<ul>
<li>

  Build their capacities on entrepreneurial and life skills
</li>
<li>
  Provide opportunities for the youth to get funds to put into their businesses and initiatives from loan lending institutions and business investors.

</li>
<li>
Enhance their experience through real life business mentorship

            <p style=" color: rgb(100, 99, 99);">We will do this by taking them through a series of training on leadership and entrepreneurship as we coach and mentor them on how to start and take their businesses to the next level. We would do this through training and one on one coaching throughout every step of their early business set up until the business reaches level where the youth can now comfortably roll with it. We will then introduce relevant real life business mentors in the business life whom they can easily access and relate with to walk with them throughout. On graduation day, we will invite potential investors to come and invest into their businesses. The Young Leaders and Entrepreneurs (YLEs) will be expected to perform a shark tank presentation in front of the potential investors who would then make a decision there and then to invest into the presented business or initiative. The organization is also going to provide interest free loans to students to help them take their business to the next level and this loan is to be paid back to the organization within the next year to help facilitate another students in our next cohort.</p>

          We are hoping that through our organization we are going to help the youth set up businesses before they graduate from universities or colleges and even employ other youths either formally or informally. This is believed to provide a ripple effect to even other members of their families and even their friends. Hence our mission statement “ To establish a poverty free Africa through Entrepreneurship, leadership training and Mentorship among the youth.”

          <li>
              The Curriculum is well researched and clearly addresses the needs of the youths in terms of entrepreneurship and leadership gap that they experience. We noted that most youths who would want to start their own initiative usually do not know how to start and even what to do even if the resources are readily available.

          </li>
          <li>
            Provide opportunities for the youth to get funds to put into their businesses and initiatives from loan lending institutions and business investors.

              Our solution is in line with 3 goals on the Sustainable Development Goals; That is goal number 1,2,9. That is No Poverty, Zero Hunger,Industry, Innovations and Infrastructure.

              Our solutions are aligned one of the president’s Big 4 Agenda, that is Manufacturing; whereby we are creating employment through our Young Leaders and Entrepreneurs through innovations. All these are aimed at achieving Kenya's Vision 2030

                  Youths in different counties in Kenya have different needs and preferences in terms of entrepreneurship and leadership needs; that is why Youth First.Org is planning to roll out its program not just within Nairobi county but if possible we can partner with various institutions in various counties such as the offices of the governors, Offices of the various first ladies in different counties in order to solve the problem of unemployment based on the research and the needs of the youths in various counties. Most of these counties are still showing indication of trying to do something on unemployment in their respective counties but we feel that we can bring with us our expertise, passion and vision to make this goal achievable and impact positively on the lives of the young youths.</p>
